# Built With [![Python][Python.py]][Python-url]

I use python to solve each and every problems because of these reasons:
* **For everyone**: Python is a popular programming language which is accessible to beginers and experienced programmers. 

* **Rich ecosystem of libraries**: Python has a various libraries and packages specifically designed for quantitative analysis and computing such as: NumPy, SciPy, z3 ...

* **Data Visualisation**: Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly enable the creation of high-quality visualizations, including plots, charts, and graphs, to represent data patterns, trends, and relationships, aiding in the interpretation and communication of quantitative results.

...

We run code in [![Jupyter][jupyterlab.ipynb]][jupyterlab-url] which is a web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
